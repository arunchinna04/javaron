              <h2 class="pad_bot1">Why JAVA</h2>
            </div>

             <p> Java is one of the best programming language created ever, and I am not saying this, because I am a passionate Java developer, but Java has proved it in last 20 years. Two decades is a big time for any Programming language, and Java has gained strength every passing day. Though there are times, when Java development slows down, but Java has responded well. Google's choice of language for Android apps development, keeps Java as front line programming language. Many graduates often ask me, which is the best programming language, which language should we learn, shall I learn Java etc. Well, it depends upon definition of your best programming language, if it's popularity then obviously Java outscore everyone, even C, which is there for almost 50 years. If it in terms of Job opportunities, again Java outscore every one. You can get tons of Jobs opportunity by learning Java programming language.You can develop core Java based server side applications, J2EE web and enterprise applications, and can even go for Android based mobile application development.</p>
             <p> Further down I will share my list of reasons and Why you should learn Java programming and Why I think Java is best programming language created ever.</p>

              <div class="pad_left1">
                  <h2 class="pad_bot1">10 reasons why you should learn Java Programming Language</h2>
              </div>

              <p>Here is my list of 10 reasons, which I tell anyone who ask my opinion about learning Java, and whether Java is best programming language in terms of opportunities, development and community support.</p>

       <div class="panel-group" id="accordion">

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       Many would be surprised to see this one of the top reason of learning Java, or considering it as best programming language, but it is. If you have steep learning curve, it would be difficult to get productive in short span of time, which is the case with most of professional project. Java has fluent English like syntax with minimum magic characters.Once a programmer is familiar with initial hurdles with installing JDK and setting up PATH and understand How Classpath works, it's pretty easy to write program in Java.

               <div id="collapseTwo" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                   <div class="panel-body">
                       In 1990s, this was the main reason of Java's popularity. Idea of platform independence is great, and Java's tag line "write once run anywhere" was enticing enough to attract lots of new development in Java. This is still one of the reason of Java being best programming language, most of Java applications are developed in Windows environment and run in UNIX platform.

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       Yes, Java is everywhere, it's on desktop, it's on mobile, it's on card, almost everywhere and so is Java programmers. I think Java programmer out number any other programming language professional. Though I don't have any data to back this up, but it's based on experience. This huge availability of Java programmers, is another reason, why organization prefer to choose Java for new development than any other programming language.

               <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
                   <div class="panel-body">
                       Another reason, which made Java popular is that it's an Object Oriented Programming language. Developing OOPS application is much easier, and it also helps to keep system modular, flexible and extensible. Once you have knowledge of key OOPS concept like Abstraction, Encapsulation, Polymorphism and Inheritance, you can use all those with Java. Java itself embodies many best practices and design pattern in it's library. Java is one of the few close to 100% OOPS programming language. Java also promotes use of SOLID and Object oriented design principles in form of open source projects like Spring, which make sure your object dependency is managed well by using dependency Injection principle.

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       Believe it or not, Eclipse and Netbeans have played a huge role to make Java one of the best programming language. Coding in IDE is pleasure, especially if you have coded in DOS Editor or Notepad. IDEâ€™s not only help in code completion but also provides powerful debugging capability, which is essential for real world development. Integrated Development Environment (IDE) made Java development much easier, faster and fluent. It's easy to search, refract and read code using IDEs. Apart from IDE, Java platform also has several other tools e.g.. Maven and ANT for building Java applications.

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       People like FREE things, Don't you? So if a programmer want to learn a programming language, or a organization wants to use a technology, COST is an important factor. Since Java is free from start, i.e. you don't need to pay anything to create Java application. This FREE thing also helped Java to become popular among individual programmers, and among large organizations. Availability of Java programmers is another big think, which makes organization to choose Java for their strategic development.

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       One more reason of Java programming language's huge success is it's Rich API and most importantly it's highly visible, because it comes with Java installation. Java provides API for I/O, networking, utilities, xml parsing, database connection, and almost everything. Whatever left is covered by open source libraries like Apache Commons, Google Guava and others.

                       Open source libraries ensures that Java should be used everywhere. Apache, Google, and other organization has contributed lot of great libraries, which makes Java development easy, faster and cost effective. There are framework like Spring, Struts, Maven, which ensures that Java development follows best practices of software craftsmanship, promotes use of design patterns and assist Java developers to get their job done. I always recommend to search for a functionality in Google, before writing your own code. There is good chance that, it's already coded, tested and available for ready to use.

                       Community is the biggest strength of Java programming language and platform. No matter, How good a language is, it wouldn't survive, if there is no community to support, help and share their knowledge. Java has been very lucky, it has lots of active forums, Stackoverflow, open source organizations and several Java user group to help everything. There is community to help beginners, advanced and even expert Java programmers. Java actually promotes taking and giving back to community habit. Lots of programmers, who use open source, contribute as commiter, tester etc. Expert programmer provides advice FREE at various Java forums and stackoverflow. This is simply amazing and gives lot of confidence to a newbie in Java.

                   <div class="panel-body">
                       When I first saw Javadoc, I was amazed. It's great piece of documentation, which tells lot of things about Java API. I think without Javadoc documentation, Java wouldn't be as popular, and it's one of the main reason, Why I think Java is best programming language. Not every one has time and intention to look at code to learn what a method do or how to use a class. Javadoc made learning easy, and provide an excellent reference while coding in Java. With advent of IDE, you don't even need to look Javadoc explicitly in browser, but you can get all information in your IDE window itself.

               </div>
           </div>

           </div>

              <p>Having said that, programming is very big field and if you look at C and UNIX, which is still surviving and even stronger enough to live another 20 years, Java also falls in same league. Though there are lot of talk about functional programming, Scala and other JVM languages, but they need to go a long way to match community, resources and popularity of Java. Also OOPS is one of the best programming paradigm, and as long as it will be there Java will remain solid.</p>
